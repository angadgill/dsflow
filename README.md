# dsflow
`dsflow` is a repository of typical workflows for Data Science in Python. Its purpose is to provide Data Scientists with a way to quickly bootstrap solutions to typical problems such as 'likelihood to x' which can be solved with binary classification. This repo will include clustering soon, please suggest more under [Issues](https://github.com/angadgill/dsflow/issues)!. 

## What
- Template workflows and library for typical machine learning problems for Data Scientists, for example:
  - 'likelihood to VIP'
  - 'likelihood to churn'
- Template takes care of:
  - Data cleanup, feature selection, model training, evaluation, cross-validation, etc.
  - Training multiple models and provides comparative visualizations.

## Why
- Jump start a new machine learning project!
- Easily share with others.
- Learn Python, machine learning, and Data Science by example.

## How
- Interface is an interactive Jupyter Notebook.
- Built using popular Python libraries: SciKit Learn, Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib.
